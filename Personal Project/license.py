### 4. **Supplemental Materials**

Include any additional materials that help understand or extend the project. This can be Jupyter notebooks with exploratory data analysis, documentation files, or examples of outputs.

### 5. **Version Control and Hosting**

- Initialize your Git repository: `git init`
- Add your files: `git add .`
- Commit the changes: `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
- Create a GitHub repository and link it to your local repo, then push your commits.

### 6. **Considerations for Deployment**

If you plan to make the Dash application accessible not just locally but also on a public server, consider deploying it on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Azure. This involves additional steps such as setting up a proper WSGI application server like Gunicorn, configuring DNS, and potentially setting up a CI/CD pipeline for continuous deployment.

By following these steps, you can create a professional presence for your project on GitHub, making it accessible and maintainable for both users and potential collaborators.
